# Outlier Engineering Node.js Reporting Challenge

Our apps need to query and store lots of information. We want to make sure that you have a good understanding of JavaScript and Node.js fundamentals. Can you build a simple API that can read data from multiple sources, aggregate, and report with Node.js while following [Outlier's best practices](https://github.com/outlier-org/onboarding/blob/master/README.md#engineering-onboarding-guide)?

## The Challenge

- Implement the `getStudent` method in `api.js`. This should fetch a student record from the `students` table in the database as indicated by the `id` passed in, and return the information as JSON.

- Implement the `getStudentGradesReport` method in `api.js`. This report should use student grade data from the following remote source: https://outlier-coding-test-data.netlify.app/grades.json, where the id in the JSON data matches the id in the students database. The output should include student details as well as their grades information, in JSON format.

- Implement the `getCourseGradesReport` method in `api.js`. This report should contain the following statistics for *each course*: highest grade of all students, lowest grade of all students, average grade across all students. Return the data in JSON format.

- Create tests relevant for the endpoints.

- You must not block the main thread. Thread blockage will be reported in the console by the server.

- Each endpoint should be performant and respond with complete data in fewer than 500ms.

- `server.js` should not be modified in this challenge.

- Part of this challenge is to evaluate your ability to deliver a creative solution that delivers on the requirements. There are no other rules besides the ones stated in this document.

## System Overview
  - Student data is stored in the `students` table in a database (students.db).
  - The database can be downloaded to your environment by running `npm run init-db`. Running this will overwrite any existing file named `students.db`. This is a [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database, which is accessed using the [knex](https://github.com/knex/knex) query builder library.
  - Remote grade data exists at https://outlier-coding-test-data.netlify.app/grades.json and does not change.
  - Running `npm start` will run the server so that you can test the existing endpoint and write your own. The server uses [express.js](https://expressjs.com/). 
  - Running `npm test` will run the unit tests in `tests.js`. Tests are written in [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).
  

## Instructions

How to attempt this challenge:

1) Create a new repo in your account and note the git url
2) Clone this repo
3) Run `npm run init-db` to initialize the local SQLite database
4) Solve the challenge
5) Set your new repo as the origin: `git remote set-url origin ${your repo url}`
6) Push your solution to your repo

You must follow these steps for your solution to be accepted -- forks or other methods will not be considered.

## Feedback

The challenge is related to our business logic and the instructions assure that candidates have to submit high quality code. We can also add to the instructions that candidates should push each change in a separate commit to get used to our workflow.
